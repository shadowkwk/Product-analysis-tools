The product I picked in this tutorial is Gaming Headset for PS4 PS5 Xbox One Switch PC with Noise Canceling Mic, Deep Bass Stereo Sound. And I picked 10 reviews from amazon and did some analysis. The first one is preprocessing analysis, I used many functions in the package nltk and I did some trick to get the better result, such as filtering and stemming. From the output, I can see many meaningful wordings, for example, love, good, well and cool, which show that what the customers are thinking. Also, some wordings show that what is the target user of the product. For example, you can see that the words son, game, and gift. The retailer might realize that they should make the headset more suitable to kids or pc games gamers.

The second test is regular expression analysis. I used the same 10 reviews from the previous analysis. I used many functions in the package re and I did some trick to get the better result, such as search, find all and match. From the output, we can easily see the frequency of any word or sentence. As a result, the retailer can do the analysis of the product and make change based on the customersâ€™ feedback. In addition, the search function can tell us where a word or sentence locate, which is useful when we are doing the analysis of the product.
